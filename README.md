# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game
 In this repository I will create my first repository showing my game made in python by tkinter GUI and an extra to turn on some leds on an arduino (optional)
# Install TKinter
```
 pip install tk  
 ```
   verfy version:  
   ```
    import tkinter  
    tkinter._test()
   ```
All images are in this repository and you don't need to download more, but you can change some images if you want.

## Run the experiments
```
python GameGUI.py
```
And now you can play
